## âœ¨ About LangGraph

LangGraph is a robust framework that allows you to build stateful, multi-agent applications that leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides essential tools for managing states, integrating various functionalities, and structuring complex workflows, enabling the creation of versatile conversational and interactive agents. This repository is crafted as a learning guide to help you experiment with LangGraph, providing hands-on practice through a structured set of notebooks.
