## ðŸ“‚ Folder Overview

This folder contains a series of notebooks exploring different aspects of LangGraph:

1. **basic_chatbot.ipynb**
   - **Description**: Constructs a simple chatbot using LangGraph. This notebook covers the basic setup and conversational flow, providing a great starting point for understanding LangGraphâ€™s chatbot capabilities.

2. **agent-with-memory.ipynb**
   - **Description**: Builds an agent with memory, enabling it to hold context across conversations. This setup makes the agent interactions feel more natural and continuous, as it recalls past information during the conversation.

3. **agent-chat-bot-with-tool.ipynb**
   - **Description**: Adds a tool integration feature to the chatbot, allowing it to access external resources or perform tasks as part of the conversation. This notebook demonstrates how LangGraph agents can be equipped with tool usage for enhanced interactions.

4. **agent-with-human-in-the-loop.ipynb**
   - **Description**: Introduces the concept of a human-in-the-loop, enabling human oversight and guidance in the agentâ€™s responses. Itâ€™s a useful feature for applications where human intervention may improve interaction quality.

5. **agent-with-human-in-the-loop-part-2.ipynb**
   - **Description**: Expands on human-in-the-loop functionality with more advanced control over when and how a human can participate in the conversation. This notebook showcases scenarios where human assistance complements the agentâ€™s decisions.

6. **agent-with-human-in-the-loop-part-3.ipynb**
   - **Description**: Finalizes the human-in-the-loop series with enhanced customization options for human involvement in agent conversations, offering refined control over collaborative responses.
